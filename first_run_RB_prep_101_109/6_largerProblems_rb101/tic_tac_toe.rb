# description
# tic tac toe is a 2 player game played on a 3x3 board. each player takes a turn and marks a square on the board. first player to reach 3 squares in a row, including diagonals, wins. if all 9 sqaures are marked and no player has 3 squares in a row, then the game is a tie.

# sequence of game play
# 1. display the initial empty 3x3 board
# 2. ask the user to mark a sqaure
# 3. computer marks a sqaure
# 4 display the updated board state
# 5. if winner, disply winner
# 6. if board is full, display tie
# 7. if neither winner nor board is full, go to #2
# 8. play again?
# 9. if yes, go to #1
# 10. thanks for playing

# my attempt before watching videos below:
# board_option_1 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
# board_option_2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# winning_options = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9], [1, 5, 9], [7, 5, 3]]
# loop do
#   user_marks = []
#   computer_marks = []
#   puts board
#   puts "What is your name?"
#   name = gets.chomp
#   puts "please mark a square by typing in the board number"
#   user_marks << user_mark = gets.chomp.to_i
#   computer_marks << computer_mark = board.sample
#   loop do
#     if winning_options.include?(user_marks)
#       puts "#{name} wins"
#     elsif winning_options.include?(computer_marks)
#       puts "Computer wins"
#     elsif
# end

# # how to display board as a matrix?
# # how to compare the users/computers selections to winning options?
# # how to ensure that user/computer cannot select a board piece that has already been chosen?
# # how to refactor board and display new board if no winner and board not full?

# # gave up and watched videos

#  LS answer below
